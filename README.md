# ToDoAPI
This basic todoAPI is an assignment from GDG Ife School of Code, my instructor is Clem and guys who have helped out include Big Yemi and iCode.

# WHAT IT DOES.
The API allows the user (Frontend) to create a task (name, description, date and completed (default set to 'false')), update a task, delete and fetch(get) a task.

I used mongoose to setup my schema and it can be seen in the model file (tasks.js)

# Issues I am facing
1. I want to design the ```Task.get``` such that the user can get the tasks either date, completed or name query.
2. I want to convert the array gotten from ```Task.get``` into a json object.

#Things I still need to learn.
React.

I look forward to any errors or changes in this code base. When you PR, holla at me on twitter @olagoketobi
